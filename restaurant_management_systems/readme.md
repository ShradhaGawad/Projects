## 🍽️ From Menus to Metrics: My Full-Course Restaurant Database Project 📊 | PL/SQL

### **Goal:**
To design and implement a relational database system that simulates the core operations of a multi-location restaurant business. This includes tracking orders, managing inventory, monitoring staff performance, and generating actionable insights via SQL analytics.

#### **Project Structure** 📁

📦 Restaurant-Management-System

├── 📜 CleanTheDB.txt # Cleans the database

└── 📜 README.md # Project overview

#### **Key Insights** 🔍
* A well-designed relational schema ensures **data consistency** and **query efficiency** across 10+ interconnected entities.
* **Staff tipping patterns** vary by state and role, highlighting opportunities for regional performance benchmarking.
* **Order frequency and cuisine popularity** correlate strongly with income trends, helping managers make smarter menu and hiring decisions.

#### Business Questions Answered 📊 
This database system provides insights into:  
📍 **Which states generate the most restaurant income?**  
🍕 **Which cuisine types are the most profitable?**  
💰 **Is there a correlation between waiter performance (tips earned) and restaurant income?**  
📉 **Which state has the highest total tips, indicating better tipping culture or service quality?**  

#### **Recommendations** 🎯
* Implement **tip performance tracking dashboards** per region to reward top staff and address underperformance.
* Use **cuisine-based revenue insights** to update menu offerings seasonally.

#### **Tools and Skills** 🧰
* **Database Platform:** Oracle SQL Developer
* **Core Concepts:** Database schema design, indexing, stored procedures, triggers
